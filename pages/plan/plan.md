In this section you can get an idea on how the day will look like,
and what you can do to make our day special.

# Preliminary plan

The whole wedding celebration will take place at the same location.
Please note that the plan may be updated closer to the wedding date depending on the restrictions.

# Dress code: Kavaj/Business Casual

The dress code is explained below.
If you have questions you are welcome to contact Linnea or Francesco.
The option to dress as a video game character is always accepted - just kidding :)

**Men:** should wear a jacket.
The jacket can be in any color, but if it is black, you can wear a colored shirt.
The trousers should preferably be the same color as the jacket, but this is not a must.
A vest is not required. The man can wear a tie or a bow tie in any color and material to his suit, but Linnea and Francesco would prefer that you choose a darker color to the tie or bow tie. Both black and brown shoes are allowed.

**Women:** can wear different types of clothing such as a dress, a skirt, an elegant suit or a jumpsuit (byxdress). If the woman wears a dress it is usually knee length and it is appropriate with more colorful clothing. It is important that the clothes do not look everyday but express a more festive atmosphere. 

# Gifts
The greatest gift we can receive is that you share this day with us. If you still feel that you would like to give us a gift, we would like a contribution to our honeymoon. More information about how you contribute will be given shortly on this webpage.
